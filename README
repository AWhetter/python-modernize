  This library is a very thin wrapper around lib2to3 to utilize it
  to make Python 2 code more modern with the intention of eventually
  porting it over to Python 3.

  It does not guarantee, but it attempts to spit out a Python 2/3
  compatible codebase.  The code that it generates has a runtime
  dependency on `six`.
